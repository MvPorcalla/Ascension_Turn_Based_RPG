Critical issue: Stackable items don’t stack properly in my inventory or storage. For example, if I have 10 Small Health Potions and I put half in the bag, then put the other half in the bag again, it occupies a new slot instead of stacking. The same problem occurs with the pocket and storage.


should i separate the popup code oof the gear and items on its own file too like the pop up potion? if yes can you give me the snippet code of the changes?
