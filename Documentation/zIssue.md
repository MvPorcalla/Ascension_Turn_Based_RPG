WeaponSO.cs

Observations / Possible Improvements

ID generation

itemID = $"weapon_{name.ToLower().Replace(" ", "_")}" in GenerateItemID() could collide if names are duplicated. Consider appending a GUID or unique suffix.

Random rolls

UnityEngine.Random.Range is fine, but consider injecting a random seed if you want reproducible rolls for testing.

Bonus calculation

Currently, CalculateBonusStat() multiplies baseValue by rarity and then adds rolled bonuses. Make sure this aligns with your intended formula. Some games multiply both base + bonus by rarity instead.

Stat formatting

FormatStatText uses the same color for everything (#ffffff). You could optionally color-code stats for readability (red for AD, blue for AP, green for HP, etc.).

SO references

rarityConfig and defaultWeaponSkill are SO references. Ensure these are set in the editor or validated at runtime; missing references will cause silent bugs.

Thread safety / runtime modifications

Rolling bonus stats modifies the SO’s bonusStats list directly. If multiple game sessions share the same SO instance, this could create side effects. Usually, you clone the SO or apply rolls in a runtime data container instead of modifying the asset itself.
