**Prologue Cutscene: Player Backstory**
(Narrated in third person)

Once upon a Tuesday—which, unsurprisingly, was the worst day of the week—a perfectly average salaryman was trudging home, dragging the weight of unpaid bills, endless meetings, existential dread, and a lifetime streak of romantic failures.

And then… **Bam!!!.**

He got hit. Not metaphorically. Not emotionally.
Literally. By a truck.
Heh—yeah, the motherfucker got the full Truck-kun treatment.

But here’s the kicker: **he wasn’t supposed to die.**
The Reaper? Yes, that’s actually a job...
They messed up. 
Apparently, someone else was on the “to-die” list, but our unlucky hero won the cosmic accident lottery.

This guy just can’t catch a break.

So the universe, with its terrible sense of humor, offered two options:

1. **Reincarnate in his own world in a random body.** Could be a bird, a worm, or a sentient rock. Roll the dice.
2. **Get isekai’d into a new world by replacing someone already dying.** A hunter who survived a brutal fight, broke every bone except for one, and was one sneeze away from death.

Naturally, he chose the second one. Because sure, that’s *logical enough* for someone who already died by truck.

And just like that, our barely-clever poor soul woke up inside a stranger’s shattered body, in a world that didn’t care about his salary, office politics, or personal grievances. A world with towers that apparently go up forever, monsters that are way too enthusiastic about killing him, and a destiny that sounded suspiciously like “become a god.”


Maybe, just maybe, in this world he could stop being a wizarding virgin… learn a thing or two… and, who knows, finally meet someone who wasn’t imaginary.

But hey… what could go wrong?

**Spoiler: everything.**

**Cutscene end.**
